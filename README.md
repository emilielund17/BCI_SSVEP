# BCI_SSVEP
This is a repository for a project in 22053
The scripts are four different deep learning models classifing SSVEP BCI data; a CNN and ResNet modelleing on 64 (CNN64, ResNet64) and 9 
(CNN9, ResNet9) channel eeg data respectivley. 
The evaluation metrics, accuracy, and ITR, is saved and stores in the new_model_metric.txt
